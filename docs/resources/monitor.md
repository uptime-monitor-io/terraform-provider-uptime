# uptime_monitor (Resource)

Uptime monitor resource for monitoring HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, and Ping endpoints.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# HTTPS monitor example
resource "uptime_monitor" "https_monitor" {
  name           = "Example Website"
  url            = "https://example.com"
  type           = "https"
  check_interval = 60
  timeout        = 30
  fail_threshold = 2
  regions        = ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1"]
  contacts       = [uptime_contact.main.id]
  
  https_settings = {
    method                       = "GET"
    expected_status_codes        = "200"
    check_certificate_expiration = true
    follow_redirects             = true
  }
}

# TCP monitor example
resource "uptime_monitor" "tcp_monitor" {
  name           = "PostgreSQL Database"
  url            = "tcp://db.example.com:5432"
  type           = "tcp"
  check_interval = 120
  timeout        = 10
  fail_threshold = 3
  regions        = ["us-east-1"]
  contacts       = [uptime_contact.main.id]
  
  # TCP monitors have minimal configuration
  # They simply check if the port is open and accepting connections
  tcp_settings = {}
}

# Ping monitor example
resource "uptime_monitor" "ping_monitor" {
  name           = "Network Gateway"
  url            = "gateway.example.com"  # Can also use IP address like "192.168.1.1"
  type           = "ping"
  check_interval = 60
  timeout        = 5
  fail_threshold = 2
  regions        = ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1"]
  contacts       = [uptime_contact.main.id]
  
  # Ping monitors have minimal configuration
  # They send ICMP packets to check if the host is reachable
  ping_settings = {}
}

# Example contact for monitor notifications
resource "uptime_contact" "main" {
  name    = "DevOps Team"
  channel = "email"

  email_settings = {
    email = "devops@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Display name for the monitor
- `type` (String) Monitor type: https, tcp, or ping
- `url` (String) The URL or endpoint to monitor. For ping monitors, you can provide just an IP address or hostname - the provider will automatically add the ping:// scheme.

### Optional

- `active` (Boolean) Whether the monitor is active and should perform checks
- `check_interval` (Number) Check interval in seconds
- `contacts` (List of String) List of contact IDs to notify when monitor status changes
- `fail_threshold` (Number) Number of consecutive failed checks before marking monitor as down. Must not exceed the number of regions.
- `host` (String) Host for certificate expiration monitoring (extracted from URL)
- `https_settings` (Attributes) HTTPS-specific configuration (only applicable when type is 'https') (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--https_settings))
- `ping_settings` (Attributes) Ping-specific configuration (only applicable when type is 'ping') (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ping_settings))
- `port` (Number) Port for certificate expiration monitoring (extracted from URL)
- `regions` (List of String) List of regions to perform checks from
- `tcp_settings` (Attributes) TCP-specific configuration (only applicable when type is 'tcp') (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tcp_settings))
- `timeout` (Number) Request timeout in seconds

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Monitor identifier

### Nested Schema for `https_settings`

Optional:

- `check_certificate_expiration` (Boolean) Whether to check SSL certificate expiration
- `expected_response_body` (String) Expected substring in the response body
- `expected_response_headers` (Map of String) Expected HTTP response headers
- `expected_status_codes` (String) Expected HTTP status codes (e.g., '200', '200-299', '200,201,301')
- `follow_redirects` (Boolean) Whether to follow HTTP redirects
- `method` (String) HTTP method to use (HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
- `request_body` (String) HTTP request body (for POST/PUT requests)
